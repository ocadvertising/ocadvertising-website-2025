"If These Walls Could Talk" brings Morris & Co.’s legacy to life by transforming recorded anecdotes about William Morris into visual narratives. Each hand-drawn animated vignette is derived from documented experiences, reinforcing a rich 160-year heritage. By blending archival material with audience participation, this is a celebration of craftsmanship, honouring Morris’s belief in thoughtfully made, high-quality design.

> “As Morris & Co. expands from predominantly B2B sales to direct to consumer through its first e-commerce site, it must find a compelling way to share its rich history with a new audience. This campaign reinterprets heritage for today, and like the Arts and Crafts movement before it, invites a wide audience to connect with enduring artistry and shop directly through Morris & Co.’s e-commerce site.”
