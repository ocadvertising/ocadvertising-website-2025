A fear of needles is the number one reason that current non-donors choose not to donate blood. And 25% of the Canadian adult population is afraid of needles. Yikes!

This campaign aims to get needle fearing eligible donors to feel confident enough to donate blood by encouraging them to bring along some friends to help support them and keep their mind off the needle. Distraction is one of the best proven techniques for overcoming needle fear during a procedure, and who better to distract you than your friends?
